This dataset was originally created by Abhishek Dada. To see the current project, which may have been updated since this version, please go here: https://universe.roboflow.com/liver-t5yvf/liver-diseases.

This dataset is part of RF100, an Intel-sponsored initiative to create a new object detection benchmark for model generalizability.

Access the RF100 Github repo: https://github.com/roboflow-ai/roboflow-100-benchmark

## Further recommended experiments:
  1. Images preprocessing
  2. further epochs
  3. further model optimization for yolo8vn (yolo8vn , yolo8vm delivered comparable results for 50 epochs)
